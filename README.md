## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

#About Me

I am a UC Berkeley graudate with a Bachelor's degree in Philosophy, and am currently working as a full time corporate immigration paralegal for a top fortune 500 tech company. 

ðŸ”­ Currently working on developing my software engineering skills at App Academy, where I am learning about various technologies related to full stack development. I have experience with two solo and one collaborative fullstack projects (and more to come), where I've discovered many wonders and joys of software engineering. I am looking to leverage my strong soft skills in critical analysis, attention to detail, and time management along with my App Academy software development experience to step into a fullstack or mobile software development role.
